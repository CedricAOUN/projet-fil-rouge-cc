### Getting started
`npm install` to get frontend dependencies
`cd backend && npm install ` for backend dependencies

### Launch in dev environment

Ensure you are back at root of the project, and run these commands in 2 separate terminals:

- `npm run dev`
- `npm run backend:dev`


### Mock data

Ensure you have a mysql server running (WAMP for now, later docker will be implemented), then run:

- `npm run backend:mockdata`
